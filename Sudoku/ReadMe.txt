This is a program that solves sudoku puzzles.
Its not good enough to solves some of the medium or hard puzzles.
If you want to play with the puzzle (use your own) you have to open this in unity.
Navigate to the Resources folder.
Then either change the file I have there called Puzzle or use your own and name it Puzzle.
If you use your own you need to use the same format as the files that are there.
There are 2 other puzzles there that you can use all you have to do is change the name to Puzzle.

There is an EXE in this folder.
